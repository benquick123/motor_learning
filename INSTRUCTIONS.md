# Participant instructions

## Functional stability limit

English:

Participants performed two trials of the FSL tests in each of six directions: forward; backward; right; left; forward right 45; forward left 45. <u>The 12 FSL trials were blocked</u>, and the order of the 12 trials within each block were randomized separately for each participant. The FSL blocks were then randomized separately for each participant, to determine the order of testing. 

The FSL tests closely followed the protocol described by Holbein-Jenny et al. (2003). Participants were instructed to place their feet in the tracings and shift their COP as far as possible in the determined direction, while maintaining at least one point of contact with each foot, and to hold that position for 2â€“3 s (figure 2). They verbally expressed when they were at their limit and felt stable, and 2 s of foot force data were collected at 180 Hz. <u>COP tracings were immediately reviewed using a graphical display and the trial was repeated if the participant was not steady, defined as anteroposterior (AP) or ML COP displacement more than 20 mm</u>. Tape marks on the floor guided the participants to shift their COP in the desired direction, although participants generally were not looking at these marks during the actual data collection.
